## Prerequisites for installing API-in-a-Boxâ„¢

It is recommended to get a local copy of WebGenAI:
1. Choose an install location (e.g., `~/dev/genai-logic`)
    * This should have sufficient disk space for your systems, including the databases
2. Download and unzip this project, either [from here](https://github.com/GenAI-Logic/genai_logic) (see screenshot at end), or using curl:
```bash
cd genai-logic
curl -LJO https://github.com/GenAI-Logic/genai-logic/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip genai-logic-main.zip
cd genai-logic-main
```
3. We'll use a local editor to open the you IDE to this location
4. Update your `webgenai/docker-compose-webg.yml`:
    1. Copy the license key you received in the registration email over: `- GENAI_LOGIC_APIKEY=<paste license here from registration email>`
        * If you have not already registered, please visit the [registration page](http://registration-genailogic.com/registration.html) to obtain a license key.
    5. GenAI-Logic uses OpenAI, which requires an Open API Key:
        1. Obtain a Key
            1. Obtain one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
            2. Authorize payments [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
        2. Update the key in this line: `- APILOGICSERVER_CHATGPT_APIKEY=<sk-proj-your-openai-key-here>`.


&nbsp;

## Login into your TerraMaster NAS

![install-setup](webgenai/images/terra-master-desktop-with-docker-manager.png)

It is recommended to have a DNS name associated to your TNAS (TerraMaster network attached storage) device.  To do this, you can edit your `/etc/hosts` file adding the IP address for your TNAS.  

```bash
...
<XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX>      my-tnas          my-tnas.local
...
```

Replace <XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX> with the actual IP address of your TNAS device.  When providing a name for your TNAS, you can immediately access the device from your browser using that name.  E.g., `http://my-tnas.local:5443`  Be aware, you may get a warning in your browser when using `http` vs. `https` until such a time when you implement SSL/TLS certificates.  You will be redirected to the Login screen, if not already authenticated to the device.

&nbsp;

## Open Docker Manager app within your TNAS Desktop

![install-setup](webgenai/images/terra-master-docker-manager.png)

Open Docker Manager and switch to the Projects tab.  

![install-setup](webgenai/images/docker-manager-projects.png)

Add a new Project by clicking the [+] plus button at the top edge of the Projects list.  The Create Project dialog opens.

![install-setup](webgenai/images/docker-manager-create-project.png)

Complete the form by gibing your project a name (e.g., `my-web-genie`) and select the path for your project.  Click the [+] button at the top edge of the Directory list to add a sub-folder.  Select the sub-folder and click [Apply] button to apply the path to your project.

![install-setup](webgenai/images/create_project_select_directory.png)

Update your projects `yaml` file by selecting the dropdown menu and specify `Create a YAML file` from the list.  In the edit form, paste your edited `yaml` file.  You must click the [Verify YAML] button before clicking [Apply]

![install-setup](webgenai/images/create_project_select_yaml_location.png)

The docker project is built and the Docker Manager will attempt start the project.

![install-setup](webgenai/images/create_project_building.png)

If your project is started successfully, you'll see your new Project listed in the Projects list and it will be marked as `Running...`.  To stop or restart your project, use the controls along the top edge of the Projects list.

![install-setup](webgenai/images/create_project_running.png)

## Edit Project in Docker Manager

You cannot edit a project while it is running, you must stop the project first.  Hover your mouse over the controls along the top of the list, to see a callout showing each button's purpose.  You'll see the `Edit` button highlight only after selecting the Project tile in the list and only if that Project is `Stopped`.  When Editing a project, a user can only edit the project's `yaml` file.  E.g., updating your `APILOGICSERVER_CHATGPT_APIKEY` or `GENAI_LOGIC_APIKEY` can easily be accomplished in this way.  Users are prohibited from updating the other setting within the project.  Therefore, to change a project's path, or rename your project, you simply delete it and recreate the project again.

## To Run WebGenAI

Once you have installed (above), start the server:

```bash
sh run_web_genai.sh
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8282](http://localhost:8282).

Find the [documentation here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/WebGenAI/).

&nbsp;

## Verify the installation

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8282/admin-app/#/Home?demo=genai_demo](http://localhost:8282/admin-app/#/Home?demo=genai_demo), and follow these steps:

![install-setup](./webgenai/images/1-create-demo.png)
![install-setup](./webgenai/images/2-open-app.png)
![install-setup](./webgenai/images/3-landing-page.png)
![install-setup](./webgenai/images/4-customer.png)
![install-setup](./webgenai/images/5-item-upd.png)

The constraint is produced by the business logic:
* The quantity change recomputed the amount (rule 4)
* The amount adjusted the amount_total (rule 3)
* The amount_total adjusted the balance (rule 2)
* The balance exceeded the credit limit (rule 1), which produced the message and reverted the transaction

```bash
Use case: Check Credit    
    1. The Customer's balance is less than the credit limit
    2. The Customer's balance is the sum of the Order amount_total where date_shipped is null
    3. The Order's amount_total is the sum of the Item amount
    4. The Item amount is the quantity * unit_price
    5. The Item unit_price is copied from the Product unit_price
```

## Run WebGenAI samples

After installation, you can try the sample prompts at `samples/web-genai-samples`.

&nbsp;

## Run API Logic Server samples 

Installation not required.

Your install includes a few sample systems at: samples.

To run the default sample:

```bash
sh run_sample.sh nw_sample
```

And then open your browser at [http://localhost:5656](http://localhost:5656).

To run a different sample, replace `nw_sample` with the sample directory.  Only 1 sample can be running at a time.

| Sample | Notes   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| nw_sample | Our take on Northwind (Customers, Orders etc), **with logic.**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Illustrates key functionality<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Extensive [Tutorial](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/) and code/logic examples |
| nw_sample_nocust | Uncustomized version of nw, created in about 5-10 seconds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Illustrates results you should obtain using your existing databases |
